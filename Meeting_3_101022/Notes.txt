Notes

Before I could you the Rladies template,
- I needed to have Rstudio 2022-7 this I had already
- I needed to upgrade quarto: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/
- I opened my project, and in the terminal tab, so not the console, I typed in:
quarto install extension beatrizmilz/quarto-rladies-theme

it asked me if I trust the author of the extension, I do,  so I answered Y
And then it went on installing the RLadies template

Not sure if i have to install the extension for every RLadies presentation I make, but we will see.

Then in the terminal again;
quarto use template beatrizmilz/quarto-rladies-theme

it askes for a directory, i answered talk45, and that became a new directory in my project.
Even a new r Project :), within my R project.
So i replaced the new qmd in this directory to rthe root of my project, and 
deleted this new folder, since the extensions where already in my root project.
It worked, so yay.
