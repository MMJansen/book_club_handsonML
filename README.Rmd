## Welcome to R-Ladies Netherlands Book Club &#x1F4DA; &#x1f1f3;&#x1f1f1;!!

R-Ladies chapters from the Netherlands are gathering forces to host online book clubs!
Currently, we are working on 
["Hands-on Machine Learning in R"](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/) 
by Bradley Boehme and Brandon Greenwell.


### Previous book clubs

- [**Advanced R**](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham.

### What to expect?

  - Highlight the key points on each topic of the book with a presentation.
  
  - Go together through the exercises.
  
  - Discuss and clarify doubts.
  
   
### When?

The events will be hosted every two weeks by different R-Ladies chapters, on Mondays at 7pm, via Zoom.

### Current agenda:

```{r, include = FALSE}

url <- ("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bNFuUWCARwyKGFMk2o0a6zs0x_cR-apKRgyJxxofI-c/edit?usp=sharing") 

gs4_deauth()

data <- read_sheet(url) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(date = as.character(date)) %>%
  select(chapter, title, description, speaker, date, hosted_by, event, hackmd)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data %>% 
filter(!is.na(speaker)) %>%
